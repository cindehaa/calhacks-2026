# Aesthetics

The design vision for the game: how it should look, sound and feel. Update it whenever a design choice is made or changes, so new art, sound and UI work starts from the same place. Dated decisions go at the bottom.

## Theme: warmth and frost

A fight on a frozen night, fought from beside a fire. The world is cold, dark and wintry; warmth is what the player brings to it: firelight, embers, a hearth to come back to between rounds.

- **Frost** is the setting: the arena, the night sky, the fog, the stone. Cool, quiet, a little hostile.
- **Warmth** is comfort and energy: the menu, the player's own glow, gold accents, the crackle of a fire. It should feel cosy, not aggressive.
- The two sit side by side rather than one beating the other. Most moments should have a bit of both: a cold scene with a warm light in it, or a warm room with frost on the window.

## Palette

What the client uses today (`client/src/style.css`, `client/src/pov.ts`). Deep night navy for the world, with warm gold as the accent.

| Role | Colour | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Background | `#0d1020` / `#0a0c1a` (3D) | Frozen night; also the fog colour |
| Panels, lines | `#171b2e`, `#2a3050` | Cold slate |
| Text, muted text | `#e8ebf5`, `#8e96b3` | Frost white, cold grey |
| Your side | `#4aa3ff` | Ice blue |
| Their side | `#ff5d6c` | Warm red |
| Elixir | `#c56cf0` | Violet, the magic in between |
| Gold accents | `#ffd27a`, `#ff9f5a` | Firelight and embers; titles, highlights |

## Sound

### Music

Every music track carries a **crackling fireplace texture** underneath the instruments, so the whole soundtrack sounds like it's played by a fire. Frost comes through the instruments: celesta, glockenspiel, music box, shimmering high strings, sleigh-bell-like percussion.

| Track | Feel |
|---|---|
| Menu | Cosy winter fireside. Warm plucked strings, celesta and soft bells, a crackling hearth up front. Relaxed, 100 BPM. |
| Battle | Fire against the cold. Driving war drums and warm brass over icy strings and glockenspiel, fire crackle underneath. 120 BPM. |
| Overtime | The same battle theme at its climax: faster drums, urgent strings, the fire roaring. 140 BPM. |

The prompts live in `tools/audio/prompts.mjs` (`MUSIC`); keep them in line with this table.

### Sound effects

Stylised and punchy, close and dry, so they read clearly over the music (`SFX_STYLE` in `tools/audio/prompts.mjs`).

**Match sounds** (`GAME_SFX`) are themed: the world sounds frozen, and the big moments flare with fire.

| Sound | Frost | Warmth |
|---|---|---|
| Arena ambience | Winter wind over a snowy arena | Faint crackling braziers, distant crowd |
| Deploy charge-up | Swirling frost | Crackling embers |
| Deploy landing | Packed snow, powder puff, icy crunch | |
| Tower hit / destroyed | Frosted stone, ice chips, ice shattering | |
| Match start | War horn across a frozen valley | |
| Double elixir | Shimmer of ice crystals | Whoosh of flame |
| Match end | | Gong, a fire flaring then settling |
| Victory | Sleigh bells, celesta | Warm, festive brass |
| Defeat | Cold wind gust | A fire dying to embers |

**Troop sets** (blade, ranged, magic, swarm, heavy, mech, beast) stay unthemed: they describe what the troop is, and a player's "fire dragon" or "robot" shouldn't sound snowy.

## Art

Troop sprites are generated per description by fal (FLUX.1 schnell, background cut by BiRefNet; `STYLE` in `api/sprites.ts`): a single unit, full body, chunky stylised 3D mobile-game art, bold silhouette, bright saturated colours, soft studio lighting. Each stands on a team-coloured ring in the 3D view; the team disc with the troop's glyph shows until the art lands. Attack-pose frames (`api/poses.ts`) redraw the same sprite mid-strike from the troop's flavor. The style isn't tuned to warmth and frost yet; it should fit a wintry night with warm light sources, and stay readable at about 64 px.

Troop quirks show on the unit: a blue tint when slowed, a white flash on a hit, a charge glow during windups, dash smears, and element-coloured particles.

## Menus and screens (G · faceted heraldry)

Designed in Paper ("Arena — UI design systems", row G) and built into the client. The low-poly arena sets the shape language; Game of Thrones sets the words.

- **Lore:** rival lords fight for the last warmth before the long winter. Wins earn **embers**; losing gives embers to the frost. Your total sets your rank: Cinder, Kindling, Hearth, Bonfire, Beacon (`client/src/embers.ts`, kept in the browser).
- **Houses:** you are always **House Raven** (blue), the opponent **House Sun** (red). Faceted shields stand in for avatars.
- **Shapes:** chamfered slabs split into a lit and a shadow facet, each sitting on a solid darker side face so it pops. No gradients beyond the facet split; no gilding, parchment or ornament.
- **Type:** Cinzel Decorative for the *Arena* wordmark, Cinzel for titles and names, Chakra Petch for everything else.
- **Colour:** amber `#ffb02e` is the everyday accent (To Battle, labels). Gold `#f3d58a` appears only on victory, ice `#dbe9f4` / `#9cc3e0` only on defeat. Ember orange `#ff8a2e` marks warmth.
- **Home:** huge amber *Arena* wordmark, the arena island centre-stage over low-poly snowy ranges, the two house banners on the flanks, ice crystals creeping in from the corners. One big **To Battle** with **Training Yard** (bot) and **Send a Raven** (friend's room) beside it.
- **Victory:** gold-lit ranges, rays and faceted gold confetti; your banner stands, theirs frosts over (*Banished to the frost*). **Defeat:** icy ranges, snow and heavy frost; your banner is the frozen one.
- Art lives in `client/public/ui` as SVG, exported from the Paper generators.

## Open questions

- Should frost and warmth map to the two teams (blue vs red), or stay a mood both sides share?
- Snow, breath fog or ember particles in the 3D arena?

## Decisions

- **2026-10-24:** Merged Isaac's troop quirks: generated sprites with attack-pose frames, status visuals, and the 3D view now starts on top of your king tower (still the only view).
- **2026-10-24:** Theme is warmth and frost. Music gets a fireplace crackle under every track; menu, battle and overtime redone to match.
- **2026-10-24:** Match sounds and arena ambience redone for warmth and frost (snow, ice, wind, embers, braziers). Troop sound sets left as they are, since they follow what the player describes.
- **2026-10-24:** Menus rebuilt in design G (faceted heraldry): home with house banners, Send a Raven room pop-up, gold Victory and frost Defeat screens, embers and ranks. To Battle opens the room pop-up until matchmaking exists.
- **2026-10-24:** The deployed site opens on a password gate (`middleware.ts`): the ARENA title in gold over the frozen-night gradient, one password field and an amber Enter button.
